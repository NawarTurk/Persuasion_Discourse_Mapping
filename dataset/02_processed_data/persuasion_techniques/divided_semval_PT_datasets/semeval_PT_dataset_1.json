First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward. He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview. The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn\u2019t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can\u2019t shoot straight and that he\u2019s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.",

Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor. And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities. What\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre. The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw \u201cmultiple gunmen.\u201d The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre",

In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil \u201cmarriage\u201d recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence. We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that \u201cthe generous response\u201d could be the ending of a particular sin. Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state. It\u2019s really just the opposite. AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin. Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says \u201ca small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.\u2019\u201d",

I have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases. Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession. With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis. Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks. This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations. As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence. As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.",

    "text": "Las Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week\u2026. The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said. Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman\u2019s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended. MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said\u2026. Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments. Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing. MGM, though, said it was \u201cconfident\u201d that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and \u201cwas derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.\u201d The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor. On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company\u2019s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier \u201cwasn\u2019t inaccurate when I provided it.\u201d Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log. Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m. The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock \u201cin close proximity to\u201d 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued. Clear, right? Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock\u2019s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below? Las Vegas police say they didn\u2019t get to the floor until after the shooting was over. But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot. The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught\u2026. \u2026 on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and \u201cimmediately responded.\u201d MGM said that \u201cMetro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.\u201d The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, \u201cI agree with the statement.\u201d These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories. As to Paddock\u2019s motive, still nothing from the investigation.",

    "text": "A 28-year-old man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after he was convicted of providing material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Justice Department said Friday. Mohamad Jamal Khweis from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted by a federal jury in June. The Justice Department said Khweis left the U.S. in 2015 and eventually crossed into Syria through Turkey late that year. Khweis spent 2.5 months as a member of ISIS in northern Syria. In 2016, he surrendered to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and was eventually turned over to U.S. authorities, the department said. \u2026 The department said Khweis used encrypted devices and mobile applications to hide his activity. After joining the militant group, he agreed to be a suicide bomber, prosecutors said\u2026. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with their ideology,\u201d Khweis said in an interview with Kurdistan24 in 2016. \u201cOur daily life was basically prayer, eating, and learning about the religion for about eight hours.\u201d Kweis graduated from Alexandria\u2019s Thomas Edison High School in 2007, where friends described him as \u201cone of the guys.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t someone who was an outcast or something like that \u2014 he was one of the guys,\u201d Harrison Weinhold told CBS News in March 2016. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything that would lead me to believe that this was, like, on the radar, that he was just going to go join ISIS.\u201d",

    "text": "AUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed. More than 500 injured. And yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks. It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day. Then, once a day. Then, once every few days. They compiled and released snippets of officers\u2019 body camera footage. They spent several minutes answering specific questions. They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong. They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion. By Oct. 13 \u2014 the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public \u2014 something had changed. The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative. Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions. Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman\u2019s room. His platform to share that information? \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d which aired last week. He hasn\u2019t made himself available to the media since. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation, and unless there\u2019s something to report, there will not be a briefing.\u201d Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office. At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation. Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department\u2019s director of communications, that the sheriff \u201cwill not be conducting interviews.\u201d \u201cAs he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing\u201d she said in an email Thursday. \u201cAnother media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.\u201d When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks. The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation. \u201cInvestigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock\u2019s life for the last few years \u2014 and they\u2019re still not done,\u201d Alston said. \u201cWe still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.\u201d She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, \u201cbut they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation \u2026 that has filled so many news stories the past month.\u201d Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman\u2019s motive remains a mystery. More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay \u2014 where the gunman was staying \u2014 has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman\u2019s hotel room and homes. Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it. Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.",

Commonly this the pattern of Judges who don't want to be overruled as frequently as 9th Circuit Judges do. Saris has apparently decided to bend to the inevitable in the case of Indonesians, who had years of hearings and appeals, all to naught, but do a little sabotage instead.However, she will not let it go quietly into the night.What we have here is that Saris realized she has no authority over the deportation of illegal aliens, but she will do her best to throw a wrench in the works by attempting to get illegal aliens released from custody, so they can then disappear into the United States and consequently not be deported.",

The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d on Muslim voters. The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week. It calls for President Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: \u201cShould the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.\u201d The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable. The current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t applaud diversity [and] doesn\u2019t respect the culture of others and doesn\u2019t respect women\u201d.

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital. Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday. Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a \u201cpotential domestic situation.\u201d A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were \u201calways arguing and fighting.\u201d \u201cThe officers gave their lives in defense of others,\u201d Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check. He called them \u201ctrue American heroes.\u201d The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings. Police released incident reports showing officers had been to Smith\u2019s home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his wife, Candace Smith. Authorities said he was wounded and was treated at a hospital. In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith, 33, went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren\u2019t getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease. She also told police that when she \u201cthreatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,\u201d the report said. Candace Smith told police her husband \u201chas a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn\u2019t on him, it is close by.\u201d Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.[More]",

The laws all contain an \u201cex parte\u201d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person\u2019s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard. This is the quintessential denial of due process. The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law. This confiscation is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation. Based on the testimony of one unrelated person. The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others. The law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d [Most of the \u201cred flag\u201d laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.] But \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined to include \u201cformer dating partners\u201d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant. So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner. Using a very low standard of proof. The standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low \u2013 one need only show \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the person may pose a risk. That\u2019s even lower than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for obtaining a search warrant. In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing. Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order. But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal trials. Rather, it need only be shown by \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others. What kind of evidence? Things like the \u201creckless storage\u201d of firearms and drinking habits can be considered. If you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble. Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner. The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely. Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove. To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others. Proving a negative is nearly impossible. Adding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.",

The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as \u201cobstruction\u201d by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.

Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d This is yet another big shake-up for Trump\u2019s still-young administration \u2014 and it may be the most important one to date. The move creates some big questions about both the administration\u2019s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president\u2019s relationship with the deep state.",

We see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Israel has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return. In the media these were described as \u201cclashes.\u201d Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people. A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted. All the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.",

First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews.

In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project. He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world\u2014another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight. Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government. Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information. By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First. \"If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident,\" Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015. \"So what if this code is a gun?\u201d The Department of Justice's surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument. It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber\u2014with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition\u2014and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet. In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses. \"I consider it a truly grand thing,\" Wilson says. \"It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable, and we helped to do that.\"",

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on 11 children found living in a filthy, makeshift compound in New Mexico (all times local): 4 p.m. A representative of a New York mosque says the raid of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico is being used as propaganda against Muslims. Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, a spokesman for the mosque, said in a video posted Thursday on Facebook that the incident was a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism. The grandfather of a severely disabled boy, who authorities say was kidnapped by his father and taken to the compound, has said remains found there are those of his grandson. The man is an imam at the New York mosque. Judan also cast doubt on a contention by prosecutors that children found at the site were being trained to use assault rifles in preparation for school shootings. He said authorities should not have made that claim without stronger evidence. The mosque has attracted radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993\u2026.",

If they had been Christian and white, stockpiling weapons and plotting school shootings, with the ringleader being the son of one of the most respected Christian preachers in the country, there wouldn\u2019t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks. There would have been feature stories in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal.

This incident, on the other hand, received very little coverage, and hardly any that touched on the Islamic aspects of the story.

Defense attorney blames Islamophobia Two Muslim men and three women are charged with 11 counts of child abuse each after police raided their compound in New Mexico and discovered 11 malnourished children living in squalor. Their lawyer argued that there was a double standard in the case because his clients were Muslims. He argued that if they had been Christian and white, \u201cwe might not be here today.\u201d Despite law enforcement authorities saying that they believe that the children were being trained to attack innocents, and that the adults were radicalized, Judge Sarah Backus released the suspects. Prosecutors also said they obtained a letter from one of the suspects telling his brother to come to the compound and die like a martyr. The lawyer for the suspects said that there was no evidence that they were planning any kind of attacks. Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe testified that they found children holding boxes of ammunition, and that one child was found with a gun\u2026",

In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes. They will be crucified in the media, yes.

During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,\u201d The Associated Press reported. A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions. Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had \u201ca common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.\u201d U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI\u2019s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants\u2019 home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy. According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared \u201cto engage in jihad and \u2026 to die as martyrs.\u201d\u2026 Siraj Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client. If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, \u201cNo one would bat an eye,\u201d Thomas Clark argued in court. \u201cIf these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that\u2019s not a big deal because there\u2019s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country. If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country. But they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us,\u201d Clark said\u2026. Last month, two state judges were forced to dismiss child neglect charges against all five adults when the local district attorney\u2019s office missed a 10-day deadline to present initial evidence of crime. A few days later, Taos-based District Attorney Donald Gallegos dropped charges related to the death of Siraj Wahhaj\u2019s son, \u201csaying he was seeking more time to assemble and analyze evidence, and that he intended to seek grand jury indictment,\u201d The Durango Herald reported.",

    "text": "Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton. Ms. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation into Mr. Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d Ms. Broaddrick said Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cNot one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel. Oh my gosh, they did not want to know about it.\u201d She pointed to the discrepancy between Democratic lack of interest in her case and the party\u2019s outrage over allegations of sexual assault leveled last week against Mr. Kavanaugh. \u201cOh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,\u201d said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham on Monday. \u201cThey would have nothing to do with it. That shows you the difference in the double standard that existed back then and still does today.\u201d Ms. Broaddrick has also lashed out at Sen. Dick Durbin, Illinois Democrat, who voted not guilty on the Clinton impeachment, as did Ms. Feinstein and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat. \u201cYou voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give a damn back then. You, Dicky Durban [sic], are a complete FRAUD.\u201d Ms. Broaddrick also said that if Senate Democrats want the FBI to investigate the 36-year-old accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh, they should reopen her 40-year-old case, too. If you want the FBI to go back that far @[email protected] to investigate Ford\u2019s allegations\u2026. let\u2019s investigate my RAPE allegations against Bill Clinton, too. Seems only fair. She has long accused Mr. Clinton of raping her a motel room in 1978 in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas attorney general. \u201cGo back that far, let\u2019s investigate my situation,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cWhy not? Everybody says well it was litigated and adjudicated\u2014my case was never litigated, it was never adjudicated. It never went to court. I was never discredited at all.\u201d Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in Maryland. The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago. \u201cDuring every step of this process, I\u2019ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable,\u201d tweeted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday. \u201cShe knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.\u201d",
