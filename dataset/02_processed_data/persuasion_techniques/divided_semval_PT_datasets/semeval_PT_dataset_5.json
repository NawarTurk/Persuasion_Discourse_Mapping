The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference. That was then. With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control. Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened. It has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie. Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only \u201con behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks\u2019 contributions are of no significance.\u201d We do not know if Pvt. Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated \u201csurge\u201d in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist embedded in that same Army unit. He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply \u201cone bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,\u201d and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called \u201cThe Good Soldiers.\u201d Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks. We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future. Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.

He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world\u2014another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight. Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government. Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information. By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First. \"If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident,\" Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015. \"So what if this code is a gun?\u201d The Department of Justice's surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument. It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber\u2014with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition\u2014and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet. In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses. \"I consider it a truly grand thing,\" Wilson says. \"It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable, and we helped to do that.\"",

    "text": "BELLEVUE, WA \u2013 The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF\u2019s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms. SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration, challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a Cold War-era law intended to control exports of military articles. Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue. The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint. Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber \u2013 including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms \u2013 are not inherently military. \u201cNot only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,\u201d noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. \u201cFor years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called \u2018weapons of war,\u2019 and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort. \u201cUnder this settlement,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case. They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech. That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.\u201d The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation\u2019s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms. Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.",

What proof of this can possibly be offered? How can we know? Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty. To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, \u201cThey shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother. . . that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things. Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:19-21). And the Preacher notes that when \u201csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear\u201d (Eccles. 8:11).",

Dating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God\u2019s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days. One might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament\u2019s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded. Converts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its \u201cNew Pentecost\u201d would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council\u2019s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, \u201cThanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,\u201d and the world now has \u201ca keener awareness of human dignity\u201d ( 44, 73).",

For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.

In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille\u2019s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to \u201cget an army together\u201d and train them for jihad. The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille\u2019s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico. The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed \u201cexorcism\u201d rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent\u2019s affidavit. The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would \u201call go to jail.\u201d Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim. The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s brother asking him to join them and become a \u201cmartyr,\u201d state prosecutors have said. They are due to appear in court in Albuquerque on Tuesday.",

Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest. When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit. One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said. Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her. After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said. Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting. Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole. In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.",

    "text": "A federal judge denied bail on Wednesday to all five members of an extended family accused of operating a training camp for a violent attack on public institutions out of their isolated New Mexico compound. During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,\u201d The Associated Press reported. A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions. Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had \u201ca common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.\u201d U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI\u2019s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants\u2019 home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy. According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared \u201cto engage in jihad and \u2026 to die as martyrs.\u201d\u2026 Siraj Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client. If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, \u201cNo one would bat an eye,\u201d Thomas Clark argued in court. \u201cIf these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that\u2019s not a big deal because there\u2019s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country. If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country. But they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us,\u201d Clark said\u2026. Last month, two state judges were forced to dismiss child neglect charges against all five adults when the local district attorney\u2019s office missed a 10-day deadline to present initial evidence of crime. A few days later, Taos-based District Attorney Donald Gallegos dropped charges related to the death of Siraj Wahhaj\u2019s son, \u201csaying he was seeking more time to assemble and analyze evidence, and that he intended to seek grand jury indictment,\u201d The Durango Herald reported.",
