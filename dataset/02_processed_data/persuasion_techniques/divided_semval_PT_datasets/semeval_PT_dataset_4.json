As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: \u201cBetween us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!\u201d (Qur\u2019an 60.4) For the Qur\u2019an, Christians \u201care only impurity\u201d (Quran 9.28),\u201d \u201cthe worst of Creation\u201d (Qur\u2019an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur\u2019an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30). We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5). Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the \u201cinfidels\u201d in exchange for his paradise: \u201cThey fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.\u201d (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you \u201cdialogue\u201d means the voice of peace, for Islam it\u2019s only another way to make war. Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naivet\u00e9 in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous. How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: \u201cTo wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (\u2026) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran. \u201c(Rome, January 20, 2014)?

Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, such accusations against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d The pope\u2019s remarks drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates. They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of \u201cpenance and prayer\u201d for his crimes in 2011. A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn\u2019t lacking. [\u2026] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis\u2019 visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover-up was likely to factor into his three-day trip to Peru that began late Thursday. Karadima\u2019s victims reported to church authorities as early as 2002 that he would kiss and fondle them in the swank Santiago parish he ran, but officials refused to believe them. Only when the victims went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to Karadima being removed from ministry. The emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start.",

The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d on Muslim voters. The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week. It calls for President Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: \u201cShould the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.\u201d The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable. The current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t applaud diversity [and] doesn\u2019t respect the culture of others and doesn\u2019t respect women\u201d. The mayor added: \u201cHe is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here. We must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.\u201d In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: \u201cIn 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted \u2018let us support Hitler the Great.\u2019 These people, corruptly elected, have no shame. For the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.\u201d \u201cTower Hamlets is home to one of the country\u2019s most diverse communities,\u201d the motion begins, adding that it \u201chas the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England \u2013 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent\u201d. After several paragraphs of platitudes about \u201ccommunity cohesion\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d, it says \u201cthis Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to \u2018retweet\u2019 Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account\u201d. It also bemoans that he has allegedly \u201cbigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond\u201d and attacks his \u201cillogical\u201d decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her. Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn\u2019t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn\u2019t you?",

The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference. That was then. With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control. Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened. It has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie. Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only \u201con behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks\u2019 contributions are of no significance.\u201d We do not know if Pvt. Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated \u201csurge\u201d in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist embedded in that same Army unit. He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply \u201cone bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,\u201d and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called \u201cThe Good Soldiers.\u201d Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks. We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future. Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.

They were not banished for being Jews,\u201d he said. In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh, who heads the Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center, drew the following analogy: \u201cImagine that you want to build a bakery. What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?\u2026 What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour? You would need a larger bakery. How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?\u201d Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh\u2019s posted his address on his personal YouTube channel on May 26. The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center. Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-\u2018Ayesh: \u201cSome people have shown up with a new fashion. We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state. They were calling for a Zionist state. That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose\u2026.",

The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior. The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has. Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression. When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States. When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York. More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons. Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.",

President Trump has sent lethal arms to Ukraine\u2014a crucial issue for Putin\u2014which President Obama refused to do. President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria, a client state of Putin, something that Obama refused to do because he didn\u2019t want to provoke Putin. Trump has expelled more Russian diplomats and sanctioned more Russian oligarchs than [Obama] has. Trump undid the Iran deal, which Russia favored, while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal.

This incident, on the other hand, received very little coverage, and hardly any that touched on the Islamic aspects of the story.

Defense attorney blames Islamophobia Two Muslim men and three women are charged with 11 counts of child abuse each after police raided their compound in New Mexico and discovered 11 malnourished children living in squalor. Their lawyer argued that there was a double standard in the case because his clients were Muslims. He argued that if they had been Christian and white, \u201cwe might not be here today.\u201d Despite law enforcement authorities saying that they believe that the children were being trained to attack innocents, and that the adults were radicalized, Judge Sarah Backus released the suspects. Prosecutors also said they obtained a letter from one of the suspects telling his brother to come to the compound and die like a martyr. The lawyer for the suspects said that there was no evidence that they were planning any kind of attacks. Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe testified that they found children holding boxes of ammunition, and that one child was found with a gun\u2026",

Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred. Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness. But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.",

    "text": "In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration. This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal. With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops\u2026.. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See\u2026. The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops. First, he insulted the abuse victims. Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.",

    "text": "\u2026. I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it. I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick. I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it. If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained? His recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable. The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well. Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion. Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters. Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written. The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it. However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did. I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years. But the Cardinal knew nothing about it! Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C. In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk. [emphasis in original]",

    "text": "Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress. (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.) Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006. In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison. Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration. According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years. \u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police. . . . [W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired. That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants. In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial. Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",

Rick Scott issued an executive order on Oct. 18 allowing election supervisors in Bay County and other counties impacted by the storm to extend early voting days and designate more early voting locations, but did not make provision for voting by fax or email. Speaking at an African American church in Boynton Beach in Palm Beach County, north of Miami, on Monday night, Gillum expressed outrage that Anderson broke election laws and allowed these approximately 150 Floridians to vote by fax or email, The Associated Press reported. \u201cThese are the stories that we know,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cImagine the ones that we don\u2019t.\u201d Meanwhile, Gillum along with Florida Democratic Sen.
