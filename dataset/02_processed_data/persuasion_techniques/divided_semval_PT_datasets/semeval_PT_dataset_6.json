The laws all contain an \u201cex parte\u201d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person\u2019s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard. This is the quintessential denial of due process. The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law. This confiscation is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation. Based on the testimony of one unrelated person. The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others. The law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d [Most of the \u201cred flag\u201d laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.] But \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined to include \u201cformer dating partners\u201d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant. So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner. Using a very low standard of proof. The standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low \u2013 one need only show \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the person may pose a risk. That\u2019s even lower than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for obtaining a search warrant. In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing. Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order. But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal trials. Rather, it need only be shown by \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others. What kind of evidence? Things like the \u201creckless storage\u201d of firearms and drinking habits can be considered. If you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble. Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner. The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely. Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove. To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others. Proving a negative is nearly impossible. Adding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.",

Patty Murray, Washington Democrat. \u201cYou voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give a damn back then.

The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago. \u201cDuring every step of this process, I\u2019ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable,\u201d tweeted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday. \u201cShe knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.\u201d",

    "text": "Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress. (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.) Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006. In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison. Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration. According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years. \u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police. . . . [W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired. That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants. In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial. Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",

Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 \u2013 during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump\u2019s push for the White House. It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers. Manafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d. His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.",
