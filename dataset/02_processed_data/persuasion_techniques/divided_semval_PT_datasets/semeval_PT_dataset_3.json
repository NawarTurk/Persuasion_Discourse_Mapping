If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret. The right to know what governments are doing in our name\u2014on our behalf or to our detriment\u2014is our moral right. Julian feels very passionately about this. There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation. There were times when I said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?\u201d Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was \u201cno.\u201d The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service. I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region. This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup. It detailed how subversion should work. Of course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on. I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela. It also reminds us that so-called \u201cmeddling\u201d by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense. The word \u201cmeddling\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.

The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference. That was then. With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control. Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened. It has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie. Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only \u201con behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks\u2019 contributions are of no significance.\u201d We do not know if Pvt. Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated \u201csurge\u201d in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist embedded in that same Army unit. He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply \u201cone bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,\u201d and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called \u201cThe Good Soldiers.\u201d Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks. We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future. Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.

First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state. They were calling for a Zionist state. That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose\u2026.",

They were not banished for being Jews,\u201d he said. In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh, who heads the Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center, drew the following analogy: \u201cImagine that you want to build a bakery. What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?\u2026 What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour? You would need a larger bakery. How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?\u201d Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh\u2019s posted his address on his personal YouTube channel on May 26. The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center. Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-\u2018Ayesh: \u201cSome people have shown up with a new fashion. We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated.

In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project. He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world\u2014another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight. Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government. Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information. By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First. \"If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident,\" Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015. \"So what if this code is a gun?\u201d The Department of Justice's surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument. It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber\u2014with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition\u2014and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet. In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses. \"I consider it a truly grand thing,\" Wilson says. \"It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable, and we helped to do that.\"",

Truer words were never spoken by an American president. Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev. To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the \u201cWatergate crisis\u201d that the military/security complex used to force Nixon\u2019s resignation. Now the military/security complex is openly inciting sedition against the President of the United States. If this plot succeeds, which is the most likely case, America will be a complete dystopia and all independent voices will be shut down.",

Defense attorney blames Islamophobia Two Muslim men and three women are charged with 11 counts of child abuse each after police raided their compound in New Mexico and discovered 11 malnourished children living in squalor. Their lawyer argued that there was a double standard in the case because his clients were Muslims. He argued that if they had been Christian and white, \u201cwe might not be here today.\u201d Despite law enforcement authorities saying that they believe that the children were being trained to attack innocents, and that the adults were radicalized, Judge Sarah Backus released the suspects. Prosecutors also said they obtained a letter from one of the suspects telling his brother to come to the compound and die like a martyr. The lawyer for the suspects said that there was no evidence that they were planning any kind of attacks. Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe testified that they found children holding boxes of ammunition, and that one child was found with a gun\u2026",

(REUTERS) \u2013 A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS PART OF GROUP TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT A SQUALID NEW MEXICO COMPOUND LAST MONTH HAS TOLD FBI AGENTS HIS MOTHER\u2019S BOYFRIEND WAS TRAINING HIM TO CONDUCT \u201cJIHAD\u201d AGAINST NON-BELIEVERS, ACCORDING TO FEDERAL COURT DOCUMENTS. By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff\u2019s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water. The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group\u2019s leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses. In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille\u2019s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to \u201cget an army together\u201d and train them for jihad. The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille\u2019s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico. The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed \u201cexorcism\u201d rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent\u2019s affidavit. The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would \u201call go to jail.\u201d Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim. The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s brother asking him to join them and become a \u201cmartyr,\u201d state prosecutors have said. They are due to appear in court in Albuquerque on Tuesday.",

It is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding\u2019s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his \u201csuccess\u201d amongst legacy press outlets. Harding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.",
