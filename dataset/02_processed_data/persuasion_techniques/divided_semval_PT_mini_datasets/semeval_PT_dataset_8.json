    "text": "After former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan\u2019s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: \u201cYou\u2019re a liar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran\u2019s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show \u2014 but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her. The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her. Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn\u2019t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn\u2019t you?",

It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end. He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up. Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed. Benedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.",

By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff\u2019s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water. The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group\u2019s leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses. In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille\u2019s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to \u201cget an army together\u201d and train them for jihad.

The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed \u201cexorcism\u201d rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent\u2019s affidavit. The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would \u201call go to jail.\u201d Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim.

There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches. Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit. American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.",
