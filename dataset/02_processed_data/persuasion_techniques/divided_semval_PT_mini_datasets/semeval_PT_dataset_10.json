    "text": "The report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton\u2019s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case. By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned \u201cvirtually every fact\u201d it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner\u2019s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin. The inspector general derided the bureau\u2019s reasons for not moving more quickly \u2014 that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn\u2019t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case \u2014 as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton. The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead. \u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d the report said.",

However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he\u2019s concluded his Russia investigation. In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report. Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok\u2019s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.

Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened. It has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie. Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only \u201con behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks\u2019 contributions are of no significance.\u201d We do not know if Pvt.

Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state. They were calling for a Zionist state. That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose\u2026.",

    "text": "Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress. (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.) Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006. In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison. Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration. According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years. \u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police. . . . [W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired. That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants. In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial. Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",

In that interview, Powell heaped effusive praise upon Power and can be seen nodding in agreement throughout. Power was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. At the time, Powell \u2013 an executive with Goldman Sachs \u2013 was pushing a pet project known as 10,000 women, which is ostensibly intended to foster female entrepreneurship. When Powell was at Goldman Sachs, her right-hand woman in the 10,000 Women program was Noa Meyer. Perhaps not so coincidentally, Meyer worked in the Bill Clinton administration\u2019s speech-writing office of then first-lady Hillary Clinton. Powell herself, is very comfortable with Hillary Clinton. In 2013, she shared a stage with Hillary at the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2007, Powell was named to the Board of a Hillary Clinton project known as \u2018Vital Voices\u2019,another women-centric operation that touts Global Ambassadorial missions for women. On June 14, 2016 Powell participated in a Summit known as the United State of Women(USW), which meshed nicely with her pet project. USW was also rife with angry left-wing Democrats seeking to get Hillary Clinton elected in 2016. In fact, Barack Obama\u2019s closest adviser Valerie Jarrett introduced Powell, who returned the introduction with effusive praise for Jarrett. The ex-Goldman Sachs executive has befriended Obama\u2019s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett. She is also very cozy with Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisers Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines.",
