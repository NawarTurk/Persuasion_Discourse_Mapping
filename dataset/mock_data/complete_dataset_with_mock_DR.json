The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor. Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said. Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor. And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities. What\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.

In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil \u201cmarriage\u201d recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence. We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that \u201cthe generous response\u201d could be the ending of a particular sin. Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state. It\u2019s really just the opposite. AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin. Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says \u201ca small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.\u2019\u201d",

Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession. With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis. Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks. This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.

    "text": "Las Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week\u2026. The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said. Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman\u2019s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended. MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said\u2026. Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments. Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing. MGM, though, said it was \u201cconfident\u201d that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and \u201cwas derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.\u201d The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor. On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company\u2019s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier \u201cwasn\u2019t inaccurate when I provided it.\u201d Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log. Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m. The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock \u201cin close proximity to\u201d 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued. Clear, right? Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock\u2019s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below? Las Vegas police say they didn\u2019t get to the floor until after the shooting was over. But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot. The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught\u2026. \u2026 on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and \u201cimmediately responded.\u201d MGM said that \u201cMetro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.\u201d The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, \u201cI agree with the statement.\u201d These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories. As to Paddock\u2019s motive, still nothing from the investigation.",

Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society. The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday\u2019s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university\u2019s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus. Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren\u2019t a fan of the names. When it was Lew\u2019s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote. Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O\u2019Manique, were also voted down. Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were \u201cconflicts of interests.\u201d",

The Justice Department said Khweis left the U.S. in 2015 and eventually crossed into Syria through Turkey late that year. Khweis spent 2.5 months as a member of ISIS in northern Syria. In 2016, he surrendered to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and was eventually turned over to U.S. authorities, the department said. \u2026 The department said Khweis used encrypted devices and mobile applications to hide his activity.

    "text": "AUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed. More than 500 injured. And yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks. It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day. Then, once a day. Then, once every few days. They compiled and released snippets of officers\u2019 body camera footage. They spent several minutes answering specific questions. They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong. They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion. By Oct. 13 \u2014 the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public \u2014 something had changed. The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative. Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions. Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman\u2019s room. His platform to share that information? \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d which aired last week. He hasn\u2019t made himself available to the media since. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation, and unless there\u2019s something to report, there will not be a briefing.\u201d Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office. At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation. Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department\u2019s director of communications, that the sheriff \u201cwill not be conducting interviews.\u201d \u201cAs he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing\u201d she said in an email Thursday. \u201cAnother media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.\u201d When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks. The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation. \u201cInvestigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock\u2019s life for the last few years \u2014 and they\u2019re still not done,\u201d Alston said. \u201cWe still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.\u201d She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, \u201cbut they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation \u2026 that has filled so many news stories the past month.\u201d Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman\u2019s motive remains a mystery. More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay \u2014 where the gunman was staying \u2014 has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman\u2019s hotel room and homes. Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it. Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.",

Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, said the prime minister should issue a prohibition order against the president like those that apply to other far right figures from the US. He cited the cases of two US far right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump. In a letter to May, he said: \u201cI am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country. \u201cIn retweeting Jayda Fransen\u2019s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity. This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets. Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.

I have lost my diocese. The headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die.

The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck, presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance. \u201cLater at ten-twenty-four p.m., one of the men places his shirt across the victim\u2019s face and then at ten-thirty-two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope,\u201d Tucker Carlson said. \u201cPolice only arrive in this area for the first time around ten-forty-five p.m. when the body is still there.\u201d The victim\u2019s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away. Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a \u201chelicopter hovering overhead.\u201d A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen. However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer. In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead. According to Carlson, the owner of the tape maintains that law enforcement investigators have never asked to see the footage.",

    "text": "A London borough \u2013 which has the highest percentage of Muslims in the UK \u2013 has voted to ban U.S. President Donald J. Trump for the area, declaring him a \u201cbigot\u201d. The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d on Muslim voters. The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week. It calls for President Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: \u201cShould the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.\u201d The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable. The current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t applaud diversity [and] doesn\u2019t respect the culture of others and doesn\u2019t respect women\u201d. The mayor added: \u201cHe is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here. We must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.\u201d In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: \u201cIn 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted \u2018let us support Hitler the Great.\u2019 These people, corruptly elected, have no shame. For the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.\u201d \u201cTower Hamlets is home to one of the country\u2019s most diverse communities,\u201d the motion begins, adding that it \u201chas the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England \u2013 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent\u201d. After several paragraphs of platitudes about \u201ccommunity cohesion\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d, it says \u201cthis Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to \u2018retweet\u2019 Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account\u201d. It also bemoans that he has allegedly \u201cbigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond\u201d and attacks his \u201cillogical\u201d decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The motion also notes that the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion in December last year\u2026.",

TPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission. \u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM. \u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff. Muhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer. \u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said. Muhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: \u201cI was really, I guess, afraid of them.\u201d",

Sadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland. Lambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. According to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX. In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like \u201clucky figures,\u201d \u201cLF,\u201d \u201clucky numbers,\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account. The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A\u2019s services. In June 2015, Lambert\u2019s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.",

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital. Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday. Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a \u201cpotential domestic situation.\u201d A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were \u201calways arguing and fighting.\u201d \u201cThe officers gave their lives in defense of others,\u201d Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check. He called them \u201ctrue American heroes.\u201d The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings. Police released incident reports showing officers had been to Smith\u2019s home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his wife, Candace Smith. Authorities said he was wounded and was treated at a hospital. In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith, 33, went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren\u2019t getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease. She also told police that when she \u201cthreatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,\u201d the report said. Candace Smith told police her husband \u201chas a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn\u2019t on him, it is close by.\u201d Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.[More]",

According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson\u2019s declaration \u201cmakes a lot of sense.\u201d With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?",

In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God. Morality, M\u00fcller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about \u201crules and exceptions\u201d ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.",

Rich Penkoski, a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ, raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter\u2019s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students, according to Christian Post. The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy \u2014 an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski\u2019s daughter. The Shahada states: \u201cThere is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\u201d Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet, saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy. \u201cI saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic. Their excuse was calligraphy,\u201d Penkoski told The Christian Post. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\u2019 First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad. The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018That is not happening. My daughter is not doing that.\u2019 My daughter told me that if she didn\u2019t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,\u201d Penkoski added\u2026. There were two different calligraphy assignments \u2014 one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post. Hinson \u201ctold the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another. She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,\u201d Branch added. Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint \u2014 this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment. Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.\u2019 The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn\u2019t have to do it. My daughter conflicted that story and said, \u2018No, that is not what was said.\u2019 What was said was, \u2018Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,\u2019\u201d Penkoski told Christian Post. Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received \u201cequitable treatment,\u201d Branch also told Christian Post. He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism \u2014 other religions took one week \u2014 and discussed each religion\u2019s beliefs, history and practices. During the section on Christianity, \u201cJesus was taught,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation. They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer, among other topics,\u201d Branch said. Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch\u2019s claims. The Lord\u2019s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post. \u201cWe did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days. We watched two different videos. We didn\u2019t finish them. They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,\u201d Brielle explained. \u201cWe learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans. We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.\u201d Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version. While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said. \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d he said. \u201c[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,\u201d he added\u2026.",

During the section on Christianity, \u201cJesus was taught,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation. They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer, among other topics,\u201d Branch said. Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch\u2019s claims. The Lord\u2019s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post. \u201cWe did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days. We watched two different videos. We didn\u2019t finish them. They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,\u201d Brielle explained. \u201cWe learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans. We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.\u201d Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version. While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said. \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d he said. \u201c[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,\u201d he added\u2026.",

Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn\u2019t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn\u2019t you?",

The injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can\u2019t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole. But it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution. If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually. Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage! It\u2019s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis. It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.",

They had a right to find out from the so-called \u201cWar Logs\u201d the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They had a right to find out about Cablegate. That\u2019s when, on Clinton\u2019s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers. You can see why Julian made enemies. But he should also have made a huge number of friends. This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise. I think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression \u201cright to know.\u201d This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening. The enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.",

Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols. The report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts. Special FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.",

They were not banished for being Jews,\u201d he said. In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh, who heads the Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center, drew the following analogy: \u201cImagine that you want to build a bakery. What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?\u2026 What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour? You would need a larger bakery. How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?\u201d Sheikh Al-\u2018Ayesh\u2019s posted his address on his personal YouTube channel on May 26. The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center. Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-\u2018Ayesh: \u201cSome people have shown up with a new fashion. We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state.

We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state. They were calling for a Zionist state. That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose\u2026.",

What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?\u2026 What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour? You would need a larger bakery.

For example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff. I was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. Republican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure. The Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984). The Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit. The Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget. This was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups\u2019 handouts in order \u201cto cut tax rates for the rich.\u201d",

On the loose, Malek cut a man\u2019s throat. He also stabbed two others. Police shot him in the leg, ruled out terrorism and blamed mental illness. In December of last year, Saleh Ali, a Syrian refugee wearing a keffiyah and waving a terrorist PLO flag, went up to a Jewish restaurant in Amsterdam, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and began smashing the windows. The police stood by and watched until he was done. And then they arrested him. Ali admitted to having fought with Jihadists in Syria. So the system decided that he needed a psychiatric evaluation",

I\u2019m kind of surprised there\u2019s been this much angst over this press conference. Not that he said things the way he should have. President Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don\u2019t quite know what people want. He actually is pretty tough on Russia. And in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the military budget, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget. We are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics. We provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia. We\u2019re developing low-yield nuclear weapons. He implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate. So if you care about actual actions, I think there\u2019s a lot to be happy about in terms of a tough posture towards Russia.

Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:19-21). And the Preacher notes that when \u201csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear\u201d (Eccles. 8:11).",

According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed. In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed. In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place. At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century. At this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare. Many nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether. Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.",

In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose. Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit. Nor was the idea of \u201crehabilitation\u201d with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned. It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.",

If they had been Christian and white, stockpiling weapons and plotting school shootings, with the ringleader being the son of one of the most respected Christian preachers in the country, there wouldn\u2019t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks. There would have been feature stories in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. CNN and MSNBC would be running special reports on toxic Christianity and the crisis in the churches.

But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual \u2014 almost exclusively homosexual \u2014 acts by clerics. We\u2019re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals. We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.

Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.\u2019s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo. In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the \u201980s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop \u201cshared his bed with seminarians,\u201d inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.

At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it. We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt. He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick. And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church! [my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren. Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock. In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them.

By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff\u2019s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water. The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group\u2019s leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses. In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille\u2019s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to \u201cget an army together\u201d and train them for jihad. The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille\u2019s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico. The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed \u201cexorcism\u201d rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent\u2019s affidavit. The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would \u201call go to jail.\u201d Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim. The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s brother asking him to join them and become a \u201cmartyr,\u201d state prosecutors have said.

Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says. When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says. The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says the apartments' \"respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar.\"",

The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, \"gave verbal commands that were ignored\" and fired twice. Jean was struck once in the torso. Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid. She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says. She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit. Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?",

Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest. When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit. One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said. Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her. After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said. Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting. Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole. In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.",

She has long accused Mr. Clinton of raping her a motel room in 1978 in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas attorney general. \u201cGo back that far, let\u2019s investigate my situation,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cWhy not? Everybody says well it was litigated and adjudicated\u2014my case was never litigated, it was never adjudicated. It never went to court. I was never discredited at all.\u201d Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in Maryland. The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago. \u201cDuring every step of this process, I\u2019ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable,\u201d tweeted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday. \u201cShe knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.\u201d",

In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison. Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration. According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years. \u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police. . . . [W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired. That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants. In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial. Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",

Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",

If you wanted a job, you went through her. Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names you do know. Then she took on the mission of promoting America to the Muslim world at the State Department. There were cultural exchanges with Iran and money for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority. Afterward it was off to make millions through philanthropy at the Goldman Sachs Foundation. Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi. Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background. But though her parents were Christians, she had the \u201cright\u201d views on Islam. In Egypt, she had described how Bush after September 11 had, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \"I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year.\u201d Habib Powell had attended such an iftar dinner. Habib Powell has been described as the Republican Huma Abedin. And she was quoted as saying that Abedin \u201cfeels a deep responsibility to encourage more mutual understanding between her beliefs and culture and American culture.\u201d",

Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 \u2013 during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump\u2019s push for the White House. It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers. Manafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d. His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.",
