**Task Overview:**

You will receive a paragraph (inserted below) along with a list of discourse relation labels from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Your task is to:

1. **Segment the Paragraph:** Divide the paragraph into two parts, Arg1 and Arg2, based on their discourse connection.
   
2. **Identify the Level 3 Relation:** Use the provided Level 3 definitions to determine the relation between Arg1 and Arg2.

3. **Infer the Level 2 Sense:** Based on the identified Level 3 relation, determine the corresponding Level 2 label.

**Paragraph:**

{paragraph}

**Example Analysis (for demonstration purposes):**

*"Jane studied hard for the exam. Consequently, she scored high marks."*

- Arg1: "Jane studied hard for the exam."
- Arg2: "Consequently, she scored high marks."
- Level 3 Relation: Result (Arg1 provides the cause for Arg2.)
- Level 2 Sense: Cause

**Output:** Cause

**Discourse Relation Labels:**

**Level 2:**
- Synchronous
- Asynchronous
- Cause
- Cause+Belief
- Cause+SpeechAct
- Condition
- Condition+SpeechAct
- Negative-Condition
- Negative-Condition+SpeechAct
- Purpose
- Concession
- Concession+SpeechAct
- Contrast
- Similarity
- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Equivalence
- Exception
- Instantiation
- Level-of-Detail
- Manner
- Substitution

**Level 3 Definitions:**

- **Asynchronous:**
  - Precedence: Arg1 precedes Arg2.
  - Succession: Arg2 precedes Arg1.

- **Cause:**
  - Reason: Arg2 explains Arg1.
  - Result: Arg1 explains Arg2.
  - NegResult: Arg1 prevents Arg2.

- **Cause+Belief:**
  - Reason+Belief: Arg2 justifies Arg1's claim.
  - Result+Belief: Arg1 justifies Arg2's claim.

- **Cause+SpeechAct:**
  - Reason+SpeechAct: Arg2 explains Arg1's speech act.
  - Result+SpeechAct: Arg1 explains Arg2's speech act.

- **Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-Cond: Arg1 is the condition for Arg2.
  - Arg2-as-Cond: Arg2 is the condition for Arg1.

- **Negative-Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-NegCond: Arg1 is the negative condition for Arg2.
  - Arg2-as-NegCond: Arg2 is the negative condition for Arg1.

- **Purpose:**
  - Arg1-as-Goal: Arg1 is the goal, Arg2 is the action.
  - Arg2-as-Goal: Arg2 is the goal, Arg1 is the action.

- **Concession:**
  - Arg1-as-Denier: Arg2 sets an expectation, Arg1 denies it.
  - Arg2-as-Denier: Arg1 sets an expectation, Arg2 denies it.

- **Concession+SpeechAct:** 
  - Arg2-as-denier+SpeechAct: Arg2 denies Arg1's speech act.

- **Instantiation:**
  - Arg1-as-Instance: Arg1 details Arg2's general statement.
  - Arg2-as-Instance: Arg2 details Arg1's general statement.

- **Level-of-Detail:** 
  - Arg1-as-Detail: Arg1 provides more detail on Arg2.
  - Arg2-as-Detail: Arg2 provides more detail on Arg1.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For the paragraph provided, your output must consist solely of a single word that indicates the Level 2 discourse sense derived from the Level 3 analysis. Any deviation from this requirement will be incorrect.
