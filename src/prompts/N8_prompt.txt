**Task Overview:**

You will receive a paragraph (inserted below) along with a list of discourse relation labels from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Your task is to:

1. **Segment the Paragraph:** Divide the paragraph into two parts, Arg1 and Arg2, based on their discourse connection.
   
2. **Identify the Level 3 Relation:** Use the provided Level 3 definitions to determine the relation between Arg1 and Arg2.

3. **Infer the Level 2 Sense:** Based on the identified Level 3 relation, determine the corresponding Level 2 label.

**Paragraph:**

{paragraph}
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For the paragraph provided, your output must consist solely of a single word that indicates the Level 2 discourse sense derived from the Level 3 analysis. Any deviation from this requirement will be incorrect.

**Level 3 Definitions and Examples:**

- **Asynchronous:**
  - Precedence: Arg1 precedes Arg2.
    - Example: "The guests left the party. Shortly after, the hosts began cleaning up."

  - NegResult: Arg1 prevents the effect in Arg2.
    - Example: "She wore a raincoat, preventing her from getting soaked."

- **Cause+Belief:**
  - Reason+Belief: Arg2 justifies the claim in Arg1.
    - Example: "He didn't believe her story since she often lied."
  - Result+Belief: Arg1 justifies the claim in Arg2.
    - Example: "He trusts her advice because it turned out to be right before."

- **Cause+SpeechAct:**
  - Reason+SpeechAct: Arg2 explains the speech act in Arg1.
    - Example: "I suggest we leave now due to the incoming storm."

    - Example: "She apologized because she realized she was wrong."

- **Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-Cond: Arg1 is the condition, Arg2 is the result.

    - Example: "The crops will thrive, provided there is enough sunlight."

- **Negative-Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-NegCond: Arg1 is the negative condition for Arg2.
    - Example: "Unless you study, you might not pass the test."

- **Concession+SpeechAct:** 
  - Arg2-as-denier+SpeechAct: Arg2 denies Arg1's speech act.

- **Instantiation:**
  - Arg1-as-Instance: Arg1 details Arg2's general statement.

    - Example: "He described his day, mentioning the meeting that took place at noon."
