You will be provided with a paragraph and a comprehensive list of potential discourse relation labels from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), including both Level 2 and Level 3 definitions. Your task is to:

1. **Divide the Paragraph:** Break the paragraph into two distinct arguments, Arg1 and Arg2, based on the discourse connection.

2. **Identify the Level 3 Relation:** Utilize the Level 3 sub-sense definitions (provided below) to determine which specific relation exists between Arg1 and Arg2.

3. **Infer the Level 2 Sense:** Based on the identified Level 3 relation, deduce the corresponding parent Level 2 label from the list provided.

4. **Output Requirement:** Your final output must be strictly one word, representing the Level 2 sense. No explanation or sub-sense notation should be included.

**Paragraph:** {paragraph}

**Discourse Relation Labels:**

**Level 2:**
- Synchronous
- Asynchronous
- Cause
- Cause+Belief
- Cause+SpeechAct
- Condition
- Condition+SpeechAct
- Negative-Condition
- Negative-Condition+SpeechAct
- Purpose
- Concession
- Concession+SpeechAct
- Contrast
- Similarity
- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Equivalence
- Exception
- Instantiation
- Level-of-Detail
- Manner
- Substitution

**Level 3 Definitions:**

- **Asynchronous:**
  - Precedence: Arg1 << Arg2
  - Succession: Arg2 << Arg1

- **Cause:**
  - Reason: Arg2 gives explanation/effect in Arg1.
  - Result: Arg1 gives explanation/effect in Arg2.
  - NegResult: Arg1 prevents effect in Arg2.

- **Cause+Belief:**
  - Reason+Belief: Arg2 justifies claim in Arg1.
  - Result+Belief: Arg1 justifies claim in Arg2.

- **Cause+SpeechAct:**
  - Reason+SpeechAct: Arg2 explains speech act in Arg1.
  - Result+SpeechAct: Arg1 explains speech act in Arg2.

- **Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-Cond: Arg1 antecedent, Arg2 consequent.
  - Arg2-as-Cond: Arg2 antecedent, Arg1 consequent.

- **Negative-Condition:**
  - Arg1-as-NegCond: Arg1 antecedent, Arg2 consequent.
  - Arg2-as-NegCond: Arg2 antecedent, Arg1 consequent.

- **Purpose:**
  - Arg1-as-Goal: Arg1 goal, Arg2 action.
  - Arg2-as-Goal: Arg2 goal, Arg1 action.

- **Concession:**
  - Arg1-as-Denier: Arg2 expectation, Arg1 denies.
  - Arg2-as-Denier: Arg1 expectation, Arg2 denies.

- **Concession+SpeechAct:** 
  - Arg2-as-denier+SpeechAct: Arg2 denies Arg1's speech act.

- **Instantiation:**
  - Arg1-as-Instance: Arg1 details from Arg2's general.
  - Arg2-as-Instance: Arg2 details from Arg1's general.

- **Level-of-Detail:** 
  - Arg1-as-Detail: Arg1 provides more detail on Arg2.
  - Arg2-as-Detail: Arg2 provides more detail on Arg1.

**Output Format:** [Level 2 Sense]

**Note:** Ensure the output is strictly one word, reflecting only the Level 2 discourse sense derived from the analysis of the Level 3 relation. No additional explanation is required.
